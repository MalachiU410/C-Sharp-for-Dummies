            var x = 3.0 + 2 - 1.5;
            // The compiler can figure out that (x) is a doubleValue
            // It looks at (3.0) and (1.5) and sees that they're of type double
            // Then it notices that (2) is an int
            // Which the compiler can convert implicitly to a double for the calculation
            // All the additional terms in (x)'s intitialization expression ends up as double types
